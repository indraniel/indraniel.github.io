title: About

I'm a software engineer working at the [The Genome Institute at Washington
University in St. Louis][1].

This blog has no theme; it's just a collection of personal notes on topics I
found interesting or useful at the time.

This blog is somewhat of a reboot.  I have an older [wordpress blog too][2].
